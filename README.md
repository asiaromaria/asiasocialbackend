# socialbackend
custom built-in "social media" api technologies used: node.js, express.js, & MongoDB Here I set up schemas and endpoint routers using crud so that our front-end can communicate to this API and make axios requests from our client server.
We created this API so that our front-end server can create users, post status, edit, etc (CRUD).
